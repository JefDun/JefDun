- 👋 Hi, I’m @JefDun
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as a hobby for now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic html.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on single page domains with section tabs.
- 📫 How to reach me, is by email (and wait any number of days before I might respond)
- 😄 Pronouns: interested, shortage of time, lost until guided by GUI, literature, video or voice.
- ⚡ Fun fact: coding is an artform. until you accept you have to work on your artistic skill, you will remain a pen-pusher equivalent. I am mostly lost when initially interested.
- ▐▀▀▀ " " " ' '  Zoom in, Focus, Take Aim & hit your prefered Targets, Reap your rewards.
- Rewards are = to efforts exerted.
